**规则1** (动态助词"过") | The aspect particle "过" occurring immediately after a verb denotes that some action took place in the past, often used to emphasize an experience. The negative form is "没(有)...过". Structure: S 没(有) V 过 O. Examples: 我去过美国。| 我没去过美国。| 正反疑问方式: S V 过 没有? / S V 没 V 过 O? / S V 过 没 V 过 O?

**规则2** (结果补语) | Complements that indicate the result of an action are called resultative complements. Resultative complements are often verbs like "懂" (understand) or adjectives like "好" (good), indicating the result of an action. Structure: S V v (adj) O. Examples: 我读懂了这句古诗。| 她买好了水果。

**规则3** (可能补语) | A potential complement is formed with the structural particle 得 inserted between a verb and a resultative complement. The negative form is made by replacing "得" with "不". The affirmative-negative interrogative form is made by juxtaposing the affirmative and negative forms. Structures: S V 得 V (Affirmative) | S V 不 V (Negative) | S V 得 V V 不 V O? (Affirmative-Negative Question). Examples: 我读得懂。| 我读不懂。| 你读得懂读不懂古诗?

**规则4** (程度补语) | Complements that indicate the degree of an action are called complements of degree. Simple complements of degree are usually made of adjectives, and the structural particle "得" is used to connect the verb and its complement of degree. The negative form is made by adding "不" before the complement. The interrogative form is made by juxtaposing the affirmative and negative forms. Structure: S O V 得 adj. Examples: 她英语说得很流利。| 她英语说得不流利。| 她英语说得流利不流利?
